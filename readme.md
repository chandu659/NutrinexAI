# Food Nutrition & Calorie Tracker

## Overview

This project provides an intelligent system for calulating yout nutritional intake and calorie consumption. By analyzing photos of your food, it accurately estimates portion sizes and identifies nutritional values, helping you maintain a balanced and personalized diet.

## Features

- **Instant Nutritional Analysis**: Upload a picture of your food, and the system will analyze it to provide information on calories, fat, sugars, proteins, and other nutritional properties.
- **Portion Estimation**: Using a simple 2D photo of your food with a reference object, such as a coin, the algorithm estimates the portion size, enhancing accuracy in nutritional breakdown.
- **Food Identification**: Automatically detects the type of food to provide tailored nutritional data, even in mixed or varied dishes.

## Getting Started

1. **Upload an Image**: Take a picture of your food with a reference object (e.g., a coin for scale) included in the frame.
2. **Receive Instant Feedback**: The system will process the image, identify the food, estimate the portion size, and calculate the nutritional values.

## Example Usage

1. Place a coin next to your plate for scale.
2. Take a clear photo of your food with the coin visible.
3. Upload the photo through the application.
4. Instantly receive data on:
   - **Calories**
   - **Macronutrients** (Carbohydrates, Fats, Proteins)
   - **Sugars**
   - **Other Nutrients** as applicable to the food type

## Applications

- **Weight Management**: Understand your caloric intake to manage weight.
